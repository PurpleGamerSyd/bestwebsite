    Title <br>
    
        It was a dark and stormy night, as Corbett walked into his sisters room, ass naked, and crying into his palms. “What are you doing stepbro?” she exclaimed, as he curled up n <br>ext to her on the bed. 
    “They were bullying me on discord!” Corbett screamed. <br>
     “It’s ok honeybun, you’ll always be my little pogchamp” she said to try and cheer him up. “And why are you naked by the way?”  <br>
    “They made me take off my clothes and do fortnite dances in front of my camera!” Corbett exclaimed. <br>
    “Go put your supreme goku cosplay on sugarbaby” <br>
    He slips on his supreme goku outfit as Shelby stares at his tits. <br>
    He glances at her longingly while he puts his wig on. Shelby continuously stares at his tits. Corbett jumps to pull his pants up. His step sis is still watching and his tit boun <br>ces. 
    “What are you looking at step-sis?!” Corbett asks with fear in his eyes. Shelby licks her lips. <br>
    “Mmmmmmmm,” Moans Shelby while staring at Corbett’s boobies. <br>
    “Would you mind taking off those socks step-sis?” Corbett asks politely. <br>
    “You are going to have to beg and suck my toes.” <br>
    “Would you please take off your socks step sister?” Corbett says on his knees. <br>
    Shelby sticks her foot in Corbetts face. He slowly takes off her socks. <br>
    “Step sis, why are your feet so dirty?” <br>
    “I stepped in dog shit earlier.” She explains. Corbett rubs the shit all over his nose and sniffs. <br>

    While Corbett is bending over his sister sticks her giant futa cock in his ass. <br>
    “UwU”, Shelby goes. <br>
    “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,” Corbett yells at the top of his lungs. <br>
    
    “00:00
    The mission is to get as much as you can. <br>
    00:02
    Achieve as much as you can. Be as much as you can. <br>
    00:05
    Because why not? <br>
    00:07
    Why would you settle for less? <br>
    00:15
    Honestly, "More" is about the next evolution of K/DA. <br>
    00:20
    We wanted the song to be big. <br>
    00:24
    Just epic. A huge anthem. Something that could be worthy <br>
    00:28
    of a follow-up to "POP/STARS." <br>
    00:35
    More than I like to admit, I do get pretty angry sometimes. <br>
    00:40
    A lot of that gets channeled into my flow <br>
    00:42
    and the way I write, which is pretty freeing. <br>
    00:52
    I try not to get burned, <br>
    00:54
    but it's not always easy when you're spitting hot flames. <br>
    00:58
    The mask helps though. <br>
    01:05
    I have more to offer than a buffet. <br>
    01:07
    If a buffet has a million things, I've got 1,000,001. <br>
    01:11
    I got looks, I got style, I got flavour, <br>
    01:14
    I got talent, I got attitude. <br>
    01:16
    I have everything you could want. <br>
    01:23
    I really, really hate mathematics.     (All my homies hate mathematics) <br>
    01:27
    Like no. <br>
    01:38
    I don't need permission to take risks, to try out new ideas. <br>
    01:42
    I mean, my career has been about mixing languages, <br>
    01:44
    pushing boundaries, defining what success is <br>
    01:47
    on my own terms. <br>
    01:49
    Restraint is(n't) really my thing.      (Hot) <br>
    02:02
    Akali that girl, Kali go grr. <br>
    02:04
    Kali don't stop.    <br>
    02:06
    Kali don't skrr. <br>
    02:07
    Kali got a job. <br>
    02:08
    Kali go to work. <br>
    02:10
    Always on fire. <br>
    02:11
    Don't get burnt.” <br>
    Corbett yelled. <br>
